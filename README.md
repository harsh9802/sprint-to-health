## Agile Implementation

The development of Sprint2Health was conducted over **4 sprints**, each lasting **14 days**, following a mix of Scrum and Kanban frameworks for an iterative and collaborative approach. Below is the sprint-wise breakdown:

### Sprint 1: Health Dashboard and Health Vitals Data Integration  
- **Objective:**  
  Build a functional health dashboard and integrate vital health data.  
- **User Stories:**  
  - Display health dashboard with vitals (Handlebars templating).  
  - Integrate backend health questions for voice interactions.  
  - Enable audio summaries of health vitals on the dashboard.  
- **Outcome:**  
  The health dashboard was fully functional and integrated with the MongoDB database using Mongoose. Code was pushed to GitHub.

### Sprint 2: Notifications and Previous Responses Tracking  
- **Objective:**  
  Add user notifications and implement tracking of previous responses.  
- **User Stories:**  
  - Notify users based on vital data.  
  - Display previous responses.  
- **Outcome:**  
  Added tracking and notifications functionality. Transitioned to Kanban for better workflow optimization during this phase.

### Sprint 3: Final Integration and Enhancements  
- **Objective:**  
  Integrate remaining features and enhance application functionality.  
- **User Stories:**  
  - Daily personalized health tips.  
  - End-to-end encryption for HIPAA compliance (using Node.js Crypto module).  
- **Outcome:**  
  The application was fully integrated, tested, and debugged, with a polished and secure final product.

### Agile Ceremonies  
Throughout the development process, we followed various Agile ceremonies and practices:  
- **Sprint Planning:** Discussed and finalized sprint goals.  
- **Sprint Review:** Evaluated progress and showcased deliverables weekly.  
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflected on challenges and identified opportunities for improvement.  
- **Daily Standups:** Ensured clear communication and quick resolution of blockers.  

For the first three sprints, the **Scrum** framework was followed, while the final sprint adopted **Kanban** to optimize workflows.  
**Jira** and **Jira Confluence** were utilized for:  
- Writing storyboards and timelines.  
- Creating, prioritizing, and assigning tasks.  
- Monitoring sprint progress.

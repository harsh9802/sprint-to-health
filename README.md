## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Sprint2Health aims to build a health-centric voice assistant to help seniors manage their health-related tasks more easily through voice commands.

**Core Idea:**  
The voice assistant is designed to simplify health management by responding to voice commands, offering health insights, reminders for medications and appointments, and ensuring a seamless, user-friendly experience for elderly users.

**Technology Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Handlebars
- **Backend:** Node.js, JavaScript
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Voice Integration:** ChatGPT API for voice responses
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption for HIPAA compliance

**Agile Approach:**  
The development follows **Scrum** and **Kanban** methodologies, broken into 4 sprints of 2 weeks each.

## Key Features

1. **Voice Assistant**  
   - Interacts with users via a fine-tuned LLM (Language Model) for health-related queries.
   - Provides responses in a configurable voice.

2. **Health Dashboard**  
   - Displays vital health information in a user-friendly format.
   - Summarizes daily health status through voice feedback.
   - Proactively asks follow-up questions based on health data.

3. **Appointment and Medicine Alerts**  
   - Sends notifications for upcoming appointments and medication schedules.
   - Users can manage appointments via a dedicated dashboard.

4. **Communication Logs Dashboard**  
   - Records all voice interactions securely for future analysis.
   - Allows doctors, relatives, and users to review past communications.

5. **Data Security with Encryption**  
   - Implements encryption mechanisms for HIPAA-compliant protection of health data.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (for the local database, or a MongoDB Atlas account)
- **ChatGPT API** (sign up for access)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sprint2health.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd sprint2health
   
3. Install dependencies
   Install all necessary Node.js packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   
4. Set up environment variables
   Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following values:
   ```plaintext
   CHATGPT_API_KEY=your-chatgpt-api-key
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri

   Replace your-chatgpt-api-key with your ChatGPT API key and your-mongodb-uri with your MongoDB connection string.
   
5. Start the application
   Run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start

6. Access the application
   Open your web browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000

Youâ€™re now ready to use Sprint2Health locally! ðŸŽ‰

## Possible Future Enhancements:
1. Doctor Portal: A platform for doctors to manage patient data and appointments.
2. Personalized Care: Tailored responses based on the userâ€™s medical history and interactions.
3. Emergency Alerts: Automatic alerts to family members and medical personnel in case of critical health changes.
4. IoT Integration: Integration with smart health devices to track real-time health vitals.
5. Multilingual Support: Expand the voice assistant to cater to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
